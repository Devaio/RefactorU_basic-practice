			Bottle openers have been around in one form or another for hundreds of years.  The oldest bottle openers, corkscrews, date back to the 1630s.  The corkscrew was invented in England due to the production of beer and cider. The churchkey opener was invented in 1898, the prototype for the modern bottle opener.  Almost exactly 100 years later, in 1990, the novelty bottle opener was created.
